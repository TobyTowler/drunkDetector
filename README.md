# Drunk Detector

## Equiptment
- Android device

## Idea
- App monitors movement
    - accelerometer
    - gyroscope
- ML to detect patterns
- communicates with car to not let you drunk drive
- locational bias
    * if at pub then more likely to be drunk
    * but at home for example could just be unsteady

- Average movement over x time


## Plan
- Use A3 app to gain training data
- 

## Possible problems
- Power consumption of constant data processing
