# Drunk Detector

## Equiptment
- Android device

## Idea
- App monitors movement
    - accelerometer
    - gyroscope
- ML to detect patterns
- communicates with car to not let you drunk drive
- locational bias
    * if at pub then more likely to be drunk
    * but at home for example could just be unsteady

- Average movement over x time
- omit stillness from model prediction
    * if standing still then there is no sure way to tell which outcome is correct


## Plan
- Use A3 app to gain training data
- 

## Possible problems
- Power consumption of constant data processing


## App TODOs
- notification manager 
    * add sms
    * sent notificaion
    * chose 50-70% threshold
- Android auto
    * dont drive and drive screen based on threshold
